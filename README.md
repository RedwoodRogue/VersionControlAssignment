Version Control keeps track of each change made to digital information that allows its users to communicate changes to people they're working with and may serve as a safety net if one must return to a previous version of their work.
The difference between Git and GitHub is that Git is a tool used for version control that can be accessed on an individual device while Github is a site that may hold and manage Git repositories.
Describe what each of the following commands do in your own words:
Git Clone: Copies a Git repository, including files, branches, and history of changes made.
Git Status: Shows what changes are or are not staged while using Git, as well as whether any files are not being monitored or affected by Git.
Git Add: Stages a new change to a file in Git.
Git Commit -m "": Indicates changes made to a file in Git within a singular session.
Git Push: Uploads commits or changes made to one's individual device to a designated site that may be viewed or interacted with via other devices
